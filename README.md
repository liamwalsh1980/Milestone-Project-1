# Embrace Autism

## Code Institute - Milestone Project 1

----

![template](assets/images/imagetemplate.png)

Embrace Autism is a website that is mainly aimed at parents and parental guardians of children that have a diagnosis of Autism (ASD â€“ Autistic Spectrum Disorder). The website provides ideas and tips on how to occupy Autistic children which will keep them happy, busy and active. As a father of an Autistic child, I know how difficult it can be to entertain and keep your child happy and active. Therefore, I had the idea to design a website that can offer help and advice drawn upon my own experiences. Embrace Autism is a website that you can access time and time again to get new ideas, parent to parent advice and useful links to external websites relevant to Autism. There is the option to subscribe to Embrace Autism by providing your name and email address to get regular new ideas.

This milestone project is the first of four that is to contribute towards my Full Stack Web Developer Diploma with Code Institute. The main requirements in this project is to design a responsive website using HTML5 and CSS3 with three web pages or three separate sections on one page. I chose to go with three webpages as I wanted to keep the home page content minimum, the about page with a high level of content and a separate page for subscribing. All this i feel would work well when using the easy-to-use menu bar to navigate around. 

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

## UX (main aims, user stories, design process)
---

### Main aims
* Is to help other parents Embrace Autism by offering their child with Autism positive activities and ways to entertain.
* To encourage parents/parental guardians and their children not to ignore the condition but instead realise what it is, embrace it and find ways to work with the condition.  
* To let parents/parental guardians know that they aren't alone and that there are many others out there that have been through challenging times when raising a child with ASD.  
* To make it easy for all users to navigate around the site using the menu navigation bar.  
* To make it easy and quick to subscribe for weekly/monthly updates offering them help and advice. 
* To offer useful links to creditable charities and organisations that can offer more in-depth advice and support.  

### User Stories

* I am a parent with a young child that's just been diagnosed with Autism. I need some general advice on what to do now that I know what my child's condition is. I don't necessarily need specific advice at this stage I just need to be pointed in the right direction.  
**Response - Embrace Autism offers useful links to charities that specialise in Autism all over the UK. A link to the National Autism Society for example will offer this parent the right step towards long term help and support.** 

* I have a teenage Son who has Autism. He only wants to play on his computer games. He hardly leaves the house and I'm concerned about this health and wellbeing.  
**Response - There would be advice on the website to support this parent, often related to encouraging routines and good habits to get into.** 

* I have five children. The two youngest are diagnosed with Autism at different levels on the spectrum. I spend a lot of time with them which leaves little time left to spend with my older children and husband. I am in need of some support to free up more time whilst keeping all my children happy and entertained.  
**Response - by subscribing to Embrace Autism this parent will get regular updates with new ideas, tips and advice to help free up more time with all members of her family.** 

* I work for a large Autism charity and see that Embrace Autism is offering advice and support from a parent's point of view with experience raising a child on the Autistic spectrum. How do I reach out to the founders of this website to provide more information and advice to help assist their users?  
**Response - There is the option to email. The email address can be found at the footer of every web page.** 

### Design Process

1. I knew I wanted to create a website based on a subject that is close to my heart.  I started the design process on pen and paper and already had the name Embrace Autism in my mind before starting the course. I wanted the website to have a minimum of 3 pages, home (index), about and subscribe with maybe a fourth page for ideas. At this stage I feel that the ideas section was best suited in the about page to start with. 

1. The design I wanted to achieve was a clean and friendly website for people to visit and return back to. Therefore, I feel the colour schemes and font choices were going to be an important part of the design process. The home and subscribe pages would have minimum content. The home page would be designed to gain the users attention and encourage them to easily navigate to the about page and subscribe page to complete the form to sign up to on-going information and advice sent by email each week or month. 

1. The about page would have most of the useful information users are looking for along with important external links to relevant charities and organisations for Autism. This page will also have some information about my families journey from when we had the formal Autism diagnoses for our son. 

1. Every Friday morning my wife and I attent an Autism workshop with other parents and NHS professionals to discuss the best ways to help when raising a child with Autism. The knowledge gained is often information i like to share with other parents and therefore the Embrace Autism website is the perfect platform for this. 

1. I found it difficult to find the perfect hero image for the home page. I wanted an image that clearly shows Autism as the focal point. (MORE INFO TO COME)

1. Issue - email address moved from footer to header and positioned underneath the menu nav bar. This is because on tablet and mobile the footer looked squashed and intidy. I therefore decided move the email address and leave the copright and social media icons in place. 

### Strategy trade-off

### Scope

![Image template](assets/images/ea-scope.png)


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Wireframes (Balsamiq)

## Features
---

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features

My project has 3 web pages all connected to each other by using the relevant link options at the top of each page in the menu navigation section.  

 

 

### All pages 

1. A header which includes a text logo at the top left which is also a link back to the home page offer convivence for the user. Top right, there is a navigation bar in the form of a horizontal menu with links to each page relevant to the description titles.  
1. A footer which includes social media icons, a generic email address for communicating and copyright icon.  
1. A generic easy on the eye background showing an Autism symbol ??? 

### Home (index.html) 

1. A hero image associated to Autism 
1. A brief description of the site 
1. Reasons to subscribe (i.e. Free service, weekly or monthly subscription options, parent to parent advice) 
1. A subscribe button to click and subscribe free, quick and easy.  

### About 

1. Our Autism Journey section  
1. Facts and figures section 
1. Why section 
1. New ideas and advice to offer 
1. Links to external sources i.e. National Autistic Society, Autism NI, Hidden Disabilities, Wikipedia, NHS etc.  
1. A subscribe button to click and subscribe free, quick and easy.  

### Subscribe 

1. A form section for subscribing to free tips and advice via emailed.  
1. The form will include a name and email section to complete along with the choice of either a weekly or monthly subscription using radio buttons.  
1. A submit button will be at the bottom of the form and once clicked a Modal message will appear to show the user the form has been completed and submitted successfully. 


* Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
* ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
1. I liked the option of adding an ideas and advice page, however, as its a new website i would need more time to develope this page as there would need to be plenty of ideas and advice over a longer period of time in order for this page to work. 
1. I considered a blog page however, i felt that at this stage the website needs to gain plenty of subcribers first before a blog can be added.
1. I also considered the option of a live chat page for parents to talk to each other and share ideas. However, the website would need to more established first and at this stage in the course i feel i don't have the skillset to implement this.
1. To lead on from the chat page idea, i would like to make sure that there is some level of security and understand the responsbilities of offering a secure website with a live chat feature. This also leads on to the idea of offering a login option for users which would tie into the website having the right level of security.

## Technologies Used
---

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

* HTML5 (All content, elements and attributes)
* CSS3 (All styling rules)
* Bootstrap5 (To assist and speed up styling)
* Balsamiq (Wireframing)



## Testing
---

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    * Go to the "Contact Us" page
    * Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    * Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    * Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
---

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

* Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
* Different configuration files?
* Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

Welcome Liam Walsh,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

--------

Happy coding!
