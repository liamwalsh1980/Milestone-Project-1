# Embrace Autism

## Code Institute - Milestone Project 1

----

![template](assets/images/imagetemplate.png)

Embrace Autism is a fictional information website that is mainly aimed at parents of those who have a child with a diagnosis of Autism (ASD – Autistic Spectrum Disorder). The website provides advice and ideas on how to occupy and keep Autistic children happy, engaged and active. As a father of an Autistic child, I know how difficult it can be to entertain and keep your child happy and fulfilled. Therefore, I had the idea to design a website that can offer help and advice drawn upon my own experiences. Embrace Autism is a website that you can access time and time again to get new ideas, parent to parent advice and useful links to external websites relevant to ASD. There is the option to subscribe to Embrace Autism mailing list by providing your name and email address to get regular new ideas, free of charge. 

This milestone project is the first of four that is to contribute towards my Full Stack Web Developer Diploma with Code Institute. The main requirements in this project is to design a responsive website using HTML5 and CSS3 with the option of using CSS libraries/frameworks like Bootstrap. There is a miniumum requirement of three web pages or three separate sections on one page. I chose to go with four webpages as I wanted to keep the homepage content minimum, the about and ideas pages relevant with the right level of content and a fourth page offering users the option to subscribe. All this i feel would work well when using the menu bar to navigate around the site.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. [delete when ready]

## UX (main aims, user stories, design process)
---

### Main aims
* To inform other parents of potential new ways to help in their day to day life when bringing up their Child with Autism.
* Offer positive activities and ways to improve the quality of life for all members of the family involved.
* To encourage parents and their children not to ignore the condition but instead realise what it is, embrace it and find ways that will work to understand and cope well with the it.  
* To let parents know that they aren't alone and that there are many other parents and families out there that have been through challenging times when raising a child with Autism. 
* To make it easy for all users to navigate around the site using the menu navigation bar to read more about the service being offered.
* To make it easy and quick to subscribe for weekly/monthly updates offering them help and advice. 
* To offer useful links to creditable charities and organisations that can offer more in-depth advice and support.
* The main aim from a developers point is to maximise as many subscribed members to Embrace Autism as possible by encouraging users to complete the very quick and easy form.

### User Stories
* I am a parent with a young child that's just been diagnosed with Autism. I need some general advice on what to do, now that I know what my child's condition is. I don't necessarily need specific advice at this stage I just need to be pointed in the right direction.  
**Response - Embrace Autism offers useful links to charities that specialise in Autism all over the UK. These links can be found on the about and ideas page. For example: A link to the National Autism Society will offer this parent the right step towards long term help and support.** 

* I have a teenage Son who has Autism. He only wants to play on his computer games. He hardly leaves the house and I'm concerned about his health and wellbeing.  
**Response - There would be advice on the website to support this parent, often related to encouraging routines and good habits to get into.** 

* I have five children. The two youngest have been diagnosed with Autism at different levels on the spectrum. I spend a lot of time with them which leaves little time left to spend with my older children and husband. I am in need of some support to free up more time whilst keeping all my children happy and entertained.  
**Response - by subscribing to Embrace Autism this parent will get regular updates with new ideas, tips and advice to help free up more time with all members of her family. They can also take a look at the useful links to see whether one of the charties can offer some advice** 

* I work for a large Autism charity and see that Embrace Autism is offering advice and support from a parent's point of view with experience raising a child on the Autistic spectrum. How do I reach out to the founders of this website to provide more information and advice to help assist their site visitors?  
**Response - 

There is the option to contact Embrace Autism by email. To send an email the user will need to click the email envelope icon which can be found within the footer next to the social media icons. The user can click the icon to open a draft email within their device. The draft will have the pre-prepopulated email address of info@embrace-autism.co.uk in the recipient section of the email. The user can then complete the email and when ready, click send.

## Design Process 

### Strategy trade-off

![Image template](assets/images/ea-strategy.png)

### Scope Plane diagram

![Image template](assets/images/ea-scope.png)

1. I knew I wanted to create a website based on a subject that is close to my heart. I came up with a good name "Embrace Autism" for the website and knew early on what type of site it was going to be, who it was aimed for and what it can offer. Once i had completed the Strategy and Scope planes knowing what was and what wasn't needed or acheiveable. I then focused on the structure and layout.

1. I wanted to keep the Structure straightforward so that all users visiting the site would see the same flow, patterns and layout making their experience on the site easy and relaxing. I wanted to make sure there was consistences with regards to the header (logo name and navigation menu) and footer throughout all pages. I also wanted to show an even and relevant amount of information depending on which page the user is on. 

1. The content for the website mostly came from my own experiences and took a little time to put together. I used a couple of external sources to help with the content from other Autism websites. Credits can be found at the bottom of this README document for reference. 

1. Once i knew what structure i had in mind i moved onto the Skeleton plane and used Balsamiq wireframes to start some blueprints on how the website looked. Initially i was building a website with three pages, however, after going through the design process early on i knew that four pages was needed to spread out the right level of content in the right places which i know would offer better UX. 

1. I wanted the website to have a minimum of three pages, home (index.html), about (about.html) and subscribe (subscribe.html). However, as mentioned above a fourth page for ideas (ideas.html) would be needed to help structure the content in the right place. I also considered a blog page, however, at this stage I feel that this would be to advanced for a new website like this and my current skillset.

1. Every Friday morning my wife and I attent an Autism intervention workshop with other parents and NHS professionals to discuss the best ways to help when raising a child with Autism. The knowledge gained is often information i like to share with other parents and therefore the Embrace Autism website idea i believe is the perfect platform to offer the information we gain from these workshops. 

1. As my target audience would be other parents with a child with Autism, the design I wanted to achieve is a clean and friendly website that is easy to use, to gain information and subscribe to a mailing list. I also wanted to make sure the wesbite was attractive enough for vistors to return back to as more information would be added over time. I felt the layout of the site, colour schemes and font choices were going to be an important part of the design process. I took my time testing different font styles in Google Fonts and chose the Ubuntu : Sans-serif font family for most of the website content. The Ubuntu font was chosen as it appears friendly and very readable to the eye. I chose the Kalam : cursive font family for the logo text and homepage cover text. The Kalam font was chosen to stand out and show as a different style compared to most of the website content.

1. The home and subscribe pages would have minimum content. The home page would be designed to gain the users attention and encourage them to easily navigate to the about page, ideas page and then onto the subscribe page to register.   

1. I changed the colour of the website a couple of times and used coolors.co site to assist with a couple of colours that worked well to compliment the light blue which i wanted to use. The coolors.co colours chosen is a dark blue and very light grey. I needed a colour to stand out when buttons are being hovered over. Therefore, i picked a strong green. Full details of all colours can be found below: -
    - Colour: hex:479ce0 (rgb:71, 156, 224) and (hsl:207°, 71%, 58%) Description: Light blue
    - Colour: hex:274c77 (rgb: 39,76,119) and (hsl:212°, 51%, 31%) Description: Dark blue (from coolors.co)
    - Colour: hex:e7ecef (rgb:231,236,239) and (hsl: 202°, 20%, 92%) Description: Very light grey (from coolors.co)
    - Colour: hex:3b9e3b (rgb: 59, 158, 59) and (hsl: 120°, 46%, 43%) Description: Strong green

1. I wanted to offer users the option of making contact by email. I was going to apply a generic email address at the top of the homepage, however after moving it about a few times, In the end i decided to add a forth icon next to the social media icons which looked much cleaner and more professional.

1. The homepage design went through a few trials with the right type of image i wanted and the positioning of it. When i found this image <a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/child-and-adult-hands-holding-colorful-heart-on-blue-sky-background-world-autism-gm1213547010-352734294" target="_blank">click here</a> i knew it would work well for what i wanted to show and the message i wanted to get across. 

1. I wanted to use all colours for the website to maximise the attraction of this page. Starting with the cover text highlighting three benefits about the website. The text was formatted as an unordered list with the bullet points removed. At first the unordered list was nested in a div element, however, i wanted the list to sit inside a semantic element to show improved web design. I used the aside element to achieve this. The colours i chose for the cover text list was dark blue (hex:274c77) with a light grey background colour using rgba(106, 112, 116, 0.7. The 'alpha' was used to show a softened colour background to appear to blend into the hero image. 

1. There was an ordered list using numbers 1-3 giving an easy step by step process to get the most from the site. However, after careful consideration i decided to remove the ordered list and strenghen the look of the navigation menu bar. 

1. Within the cover text there is a 'SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE' button which is linked to the subscribe page. This button is dark blue (hex:274c77) with the text in light grey (hex:e7ecef). The wording is in capital letters and when hovering over this button the colour of the button changes to a strong green colour. After removing the ordered list i had the option to increase the size of this cover text and 'SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE' button more visiable to users. 

1. The about page has information in the form of a paragaph about my families personal journey with Autism. This information sits within a dark blue background colour (hex:274c77) with the font Ubuntu and the colour of the font being a very light grey (hex:e7ecef). Below this paragraph there is some additional content encouraging the user to visit the ideas page and subscribe page. The text is also in very light grey (hex:e7ecef). Underneath this text there is a 'SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE' button which is linked to the subscribe page. This button is light blue (hex:479ce0) with the text in dark blue (hex:274c77. The wording is in capital letters and when hovering over this button the colour of the button changes to a strong green colour.

1. The ideas page 
useful information along with important external links to relevant charities and organisations for Autism. This page will also have some information about my families journey from when we had the formal Autism diagnoses our Son. I decided to keep this page simple with colours and breakup the information into sections i.e. Our Autism Journey, What worked for us and Useful links. This was done using horizontal rows. After the 'What worked for us' section and before the 'Useful links' section there is another 'SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE' button which is linked to the subscribe page to click on. 
This button is dark blue (hex:274c77) with the text in light grey (hex:e7ecef). The wording is in capital letters and when hovering over this button the colour of the button changes to light blue (hex:479ce0). Useful Links section includes three chartiy organisation links for users to click. These links are external to the website and therefore will open in a new tab page on the users browser. This is to make sure that if the user wants to return to the Embrace Autism website the site is there to click back on.

1. The subcribe page  

1. Media queries 
    - The navbar is created using bootstrap and therefore mobile first responsive. 
    - Hero-image has been adjusted in size to fit all screeen sizes.
    - The cover text and subscribe button has had media queries applied to adjust the positioning and to fit in with all mobile, tablet and desktop sizes.


### Strategy trade-off

![Image template](assets/images/ea-strategy.png)

### Scope

![Image template](assets/images/ea-scope.png)


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
---

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features

#### All four pages 

* My project has 4 web pages with the same header and footer formated. All pages are connected to each other by using the relevant link options at the top of each page in the menu navigation bar. The defaults set across all pages are as follows: - 

    - Font style: Ubuntu with Sans-serif incase google fonts doesn't load
    - Font colour: dark blue (hex:274c77)
    - Background colour: very light grey (hex:e7ecef)

* The header has a text logo called 'Embrace Autism' in dark blue (hex:274c77) at the top left. When hovering over the logo text the dark blue colour (hex:274c77) changes to light blue (hex:479ce0). This gives the user an indication that it’s a link and when clicked, it will bring the user back to the homepage (index.html) for convenience. On the right side of the header there is a horizontal navigtion bar showing the following pages available: - home, about, ideas and subscribe. The font colour for all four page titles is light blue (hex:479ce0) and when hovering over one of the page titles the colour will change from light blue (hex:479ce0) to dark blue (hex:274c77). This shows a user that these page titles are links and that when hovering over one of them, it can also be clicked to move to that particular page within the site. A user will know what page they're on because the relevant page title will be highlighted in dark blue (hex:274c77) and underlined in the same colour. At this time the other pages will be shown in light blue (hex:479ce0) by default. This gives the user clear indication of what page they are currently on and what pages are available to hover over and click on. 

* The footer has social media icons to facebook, instgram and twitter. These are all links to the relevant sites making it easy for a user to click through to. Each link will be opened in a new tab making it easy for the user to come back to the Embrace Autism site as it will still be open on the users browser. There is an email icon next to the social media icons which will give users the option to click on. This will open up a new blank email draft ready to use and send back to Embrace Autism's genertic emaill account. All four icons are structured evenly in the centre of the screen at the bottom of every page. There is good spacing between each icon to make it easy users to click on without making the mistake of clicking the wrong one. All icons have the colour of light blue (hex:479ce0). When a user hovers over a particular icon the light blue (hex:479ce0) turns dark blue (hex:274c77) showing the user which icon they are about to select when clicked. Below the icons there is a short paragraph for copyright which again is central and at the bottom of every page. The colour of this paragraph is dark blue (hex:274c77). 


#### Homepage (index.html) 

* The main feature of this page is a large hero image with a light blue cloud like background. At the forefront of the image there is two sets of hands embracing a small heartshape colourful object. This image will indidcate to users that its a loving, embracing and welcoming site which should gain immediate attention. 

There is a small list of benefits about the website which sits within the large hero image. The text is in dark blue (hex:274c77) and in the 

Withi

### Mobile responsive

### Tablet responsive


* Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
* ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
1. I liked the option of adding an ideas and advice page, however, as its a new website i would need more time to develope this page as there would need to be plenty of ideas and advice over a longer period of time in order for this page to work. 
1. I considered a blog page however, i felt that at this stage the website needs to gain plenty of subcribers first before a blog can be added.
1. I also considered the option of a live chat page for parents to talk to each other and share ideas. However, the website would need to more established first and at this stage in the course i feel i don't have the skillset to implement this.
1. To lead on from the chat page idea, i would like to make sure that there is some level of security and understand the responsbilities of offering a secure website with a live chat feature. This also leads on to the idea of offering a login option for users which would tie into the website having the right level of security.

## Technologies Used
---

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

* HTML5 (All content, elements and attributes)
* CSS3 (All styling rules)
* Bootstrap5 (To assist and speed up styling)
* Balsamiq (Wireframing)



## Testing
---

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    * Go to the "Contact Us" page
    * Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    * Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    * Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
---

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

* Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
* Different configuration files?
* Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

![CI logo](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/ci_logo_small.png)

Welcome Liam Walsh,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

--------

Happy coding!
