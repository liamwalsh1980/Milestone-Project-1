                <p class="bg-color-change-about">
                    In 2014 my Wife and I had a Son, Riley. We both released that Riley's development had stopped when
                    he was around 18 months of age. We decided to speak with our local GP who referred him for
                    occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech & language tests. After many appointments over an
                    18-month period and just before Riley turned 3 years of age, we received a formal diagnosis of
                    <span class="autism">Autism</span>. </p>
                <p class="bg-color-change-about">
                    My wife and I were both shocked an unprepared for the fact that our lives were going to change
                    forever. We looked for information online but didn't know which information to use. Riley's
                    Pedestrian gave us some information about
                    <span class="autism">Autism</span> workshops for parents, which we attended and found very useful.
                    Upon attending these workshops, we found the advice we received from other parents invaluable as
                    well. One piece of advice I remember more than anything else was to learn to accept the condition.
                    From that point, we as a family, chose to Embrace <span class="autism">Autism</span> and
                    accept the challenges ahead.
                </p>
                <p class="bg-color-change-about">
                    Riley is 7 years old now and doing very well. Over the last 4 years, we as a family, have learned
                    a lot. With the experiences we have gained I felt it to be the right time to offer support to other
                    parents who are starting the same journey. We know how difficult it is to get support and advice and
                    therefore, I decided to create this website to help support other parents.
