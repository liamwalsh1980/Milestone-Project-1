                                It may be small trips at first but it is the best thing you can do. You’re teaching your
                                child coping skills in the real world. People have to food shop, go to the bank, post
                                office, (scroll down) etc. Whether your child is autistic or not it's likely you will
                                need to go out anyway. Know your child's limits and take baby setups to start with. The
                                first time you try, it could be to the local shops to buy some milk and therefore a
                                short 10-minute trip is a good start. The next time could be a trip into the city centre
                                for a couple of hours. Whatever trip it is, stay positive and make it a fun experience
                                for all the family. Remember, you can't stop going out as life needs to continue for you
                                and your family. The best tip which works for us is to sit down with your child shortly
                                before going out and inform there where you are going and what to expect. We often use
                                visuals to show our child what shop we are going to. There are certain shops that your
                                child will prefer to go to. For example, Sainsburys in our household is classed as the
                                orange shop and is a preferred shop to buy food. My son will see the trip to the orange
                                shop as a good experience. Don't change the plans and stick to what you have said to
                                your child to avoid confusion and potential meltdowns.

                            <h4 id="routines">Routines and good habits</h4>
                            <p>Children thrive on routine. All children learn best from repetition, and children with
                                autism spectrum disorder (ASD) especially appreciate predictability and patterns.
                                Establishing routines at home can promote positive bonds between children and parents
                                and ease the unpredictability of everyday life for young children.Some families like the
                                idea of having structured homes with lots of predictability, while other families
                                succeed with a more flexible lifestyle. Regardless, certain activities like mealtimes
                                and bedtimes occur daily, so most families find creating
                                patterns around these activities helpful. Identify each step of a task you’d like your
                                child to complete, and list the steps. Use the steps to create a schedule. Use whatever
                                form of schedule works for your child, like a picture essay, task list or video model.
                                Use timers or alarms to signal when the schedule will begin or to allot a certain time
                                to a step. Refer to the schedule throughout the routine. Provide praise or other
                                reinforcement for completing steps. Be consistent. Complete every step of the routine
                                every time. Whatever routine you decide to promote at home, remember that it takes time
                                for children to learn. Be consistent, and don’t give up. Once your child begins to
                                complete the routine without help or problem behavior, he may no longer need visual
                                supports. Allow these supports to gradually disappear as the need for them lessens.
                                Some children become so attached to routines that they become upset at any change. It’s
                                important that you help your child develop a little flexibility as well. Once a routine
                                is firmly established, allow for naturally occurring changes, such as changing the
                                routine’s location when staying over at a family member’s house or adding a new step,
                                like flossing after brushing teeth. This will help the routine feel safe and helpful but
                                not rigid and compulsive.

                            <p>
                                As a parent of a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder, one of the biggest challenges you
                                could face relates to one of the most fundamental aspects of being a doting parent:
                                understanding your child’s wants and needs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You want nothing more in this world than to be able to know when your child is hungry
                                and what they would like to eat… or when they need some extra attention and comforting.
                                You might struggle to tell whether your child is amused with the things going on around
                                them… or scared and bewildered. You might find yourself unsure of whether your child
                                feels comfortable and secure in an unfamiliar environment… or anxious and apprehensive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Without knowing when your child is hungry or cold or feeling insecure or frightened, it
                                might feel impossible to be the best parent you can be. For many parents, this is a
                                scary situation that comes with a lot of worry. Having a child with autism makes this
                                difficult enough, but if your child is non-verbal the challenges are compounded. This
                                could easily become something that keeps you up at night.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While speaking is the goal for many parents, many children can find equally effective
                                ways to communicate nonverbally. In fact, many of these non-verbal communications, like
                                hand gestures and eye contact, are the building blocks for language. So, it’s important
                                to encourage their development as a precursor to speech. Be sure to model these behaviors for your child by exaggerating your own hand gestures and making it easy for your child to copy you. When you want your child to pick up a
                                toy, don’t just ask them, but point to the toy with your hand and nod “yes” when they
                                select the right one.Clapping, holding out your arms, and opening your hands are universally recognized gestures even a young, non-verbal child is likely to be able to interpret.
